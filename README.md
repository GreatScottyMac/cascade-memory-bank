# üß† Cascade Memory Bank

Enhance your Windsurf IDE experience with persistent project memory. Cascade Memory Bank enables the Cascade AI assistant to maintain deep project understanding across sessions, automatically documenting important context, decisions, and progress.

[View Developer's Guide](developer-primer.md) for detailed implementation information.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/cascade-memory-bank.git
   cp cascade-memory-bank/.windsurfrules /path/to/your/project/
   ```
   Or paste `.windsurfrules` contents into Windsurf's "Set Workspace AI Rules".

2. **Configure Git**
   Recommended `.gitignore` setup:
   ```bash
   # Ignore everything by default
   *

   # Then list what should be in version control
   !/.gitignore
   !/src/
   !/src/**
   !/package.json
   # etc.
   ```
   
   > **Pro Tip**: Simply delete the `*` line when starting a Cascade session to give AI full access. Add it back before committing.
   
   Alternative approach:
   ```bash
   # Explicitly ignore Cascade files
   .windsurfrules
   memory-bank/
   ```
   
   > **Note**: This repository version controls these files as it is the reference implementation.

3. **Start Using**
   - Begin by telling Cascade: "Follow the protocol in your .windsurfrules"
   - Memory bank initializes and loads all context
   - Project context updates automatically in real-time

## üìÅ Memory Bank Structure

The system maintains context through a `memory-bank/` directory containing four core files:

### Core Files

| File | Purpose | Updates |
|------|---------|---------|
| `activeContext.md` | Tracks session state and goals | Every session |
| `productContext.md` | Defines project scope and architecture | When scope changes |
| `progress.md` | Tracks work status and milestones | As tasks progress |
| `decisionLog.md` | Records important decisions | When decisions made |

## üéØ Benefits

- **Enhanced Productivity**
  - No context loss between sessions
  - Reduced onboarding time for new tasks
  - Automatic documentation maintenance

- **Better Project Understanding**
  - Comprehensive decision history
