# üß† Cascade Memory Bank

Enhance your Windsurf IDE experience with persistent project memory. Cascade Memory Bank enables the Cascade AI assistant to maintain deep project understanding across sessions, automatically documenting important context, decisions, and progress.

[View Developer's Guide](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/cascade-memory-bank/blob/main/Developers/developer-primer.md) for detailed implementation information.

### Start Using
   - Begin by telling Cascade: "Follow the protocol in your rules" (you may also include the initial task)
   - Memory bank initializes and loads all context
   - Project context updates automatically in real-time
   - Use "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" trigger for manual updates (defined in `.windsurfrules`)

## üìÅ Memory Bank Structure

The system maintains context through a `memory-bank/` directory containing four core files:

### Core Files

| File | Purpose | Updates |
|------|---------|---------|
| `activeContext.md` | Tracks session state and goals | Every session |
| `productContext.md` | Defines project scope and architecture | When scope changes |
| `progress.md` | Tracks work status and milestones | As tasks progress |
| `decisionLog.md` | Records important decisions | When decisions made |
