# üî¨ Cascade Memory Bank: Developer's Primer

## üìö Overview

The Cascade Memory Bank is an intelligent context management system that maintains project knowledge across sessions. It uses a structured approach to document, track, and evolve project context through carefully organized markdown files.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Development Workflow

The project follows a specific workflow for modifying AI rules:

1. **Development Files**
   All development files are located in the `Developers/` directory:
   - `.windsurfrules-dev`: Current working version of rules
   - `.windsurfrules-old`: Previous version backup
   - `global_rules-dev.md`: Current working version of global rules
   - `global_rules-old.md`: Previous version backup
   - `developer-primer.md`: Development documentation

2. **File Purposes**
   - `.windsurfrules`: Production rules file (managed by system)
   - `.windsurfrules-dev`: Development version for active changes
   - `.windsurfrules-old`: Backup of previous version
   - `global_rules.md`: Global AI rules (in `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/`)
   - `global_rules-dev.md`: Development version of global rules
   - `global_rules-old.md`: Backup of previous global rules

3. **Development Process**
   - All changes are made in `-dev` files
   - Changes are tested and reviewed
   - System manages copying from `-dev` to production
   - Previous versions automatically backed up to `-old`

4. **Workflow Benefits**
   - Prevents accidental system file modifications
   - Maintains version history through `-old` files
   - Provides clear separation of development/production
   - Allows testing without affecting active sessions
   - Preserves previous versions for reference

### Configuration Format

The `.windsurfrules` file uses YAML format, specifically chosen for its advantages in AI-driven systems:

- **AI-Optimized Structure**
  - Clear hierarchical organization
  - Consistent indentation-based nesting
  - Explicit key-value relationships
  - Efficient machine parsing

- **Human-Friendly**
  - Natural text-based format
  - Easy manual review and editing
  - Self-documenting structure
  - Minimal syntax overhead

- **Flexibility**
  - Supports complex data structures
  - Easy to extend and modify
  - Maintains readability at scale
  - Compatible with most tools

### Version Control Configuration

#### Git Configuration Approaches

1. **Recommended: Restrictive Default**
   ```bash
   # Ignore everything by default
   *

   # Then list what should be in version control
   !/.gitignore
   !/src/
   !/src/**
   !/package.json
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Working with Cascade**
   - Delete `*` line when starting a session
   - This gives AI full file access
   - Add `*` back before committing
   - One-line toggle for AI access

3. **Benefits**
   - Simplest possible AI access management
   - Clear version control boundaries
   - Easy to switch between modes
   - Prevents accidental commits

4. **Alternative Approach**
   ```bash
   # Explicitly ignore Cascade files
   .windsurfrules
   memory-bank/
   ```
   - Comment/uncomment as needed
   - More explicit but requires managing multiple lines

#### This Repository

As this repository is the Cascade Memory Bank project itself, it's an exception:
- Version controls .windsurfrules and memory-bank/
- Uses restrictive .gitignore with explicit allows
- Serves as reference implementation

### Core Components

1. **Memory Bank Directory** (`memory-bank/`)
   - Self-contained context storage
   - Markdown-based for maximum compatibility
   - Structured for easy parsing and updates

2. **Core Files**
   - `activeContext.md`: Session state and immediate goals
   - `productContext.md`: Project scope and architectural decisions
   - `progress.md`: Task status and milestone tracking
   - `decisionLog.md`: Technical and architectural decisions

### Interaction Handling

The system intelligently filters interactions into two categories:

1. **Project-Relevant**
   - Code changes and implementation details
   - Architecture and design decisions
   - Configuration updates
   - Documentation changes
   - Task status updates

2. **Non-Project**
   - General knowledge questions
   - Off-topic discussions
   - Test queries
   - Temporary debugging outputs

### Update Protocol

Updates follow a priority system:

**High Priority**
- Critical decisions
- Blocking issues
- Major code changes

**Medium Priority**
- Progress updates
- New questions
- Minor code changes

**Low Priority**
- Documentation improvements
- Clarifications
- Reference updates

## üîÑ Operation Flow

### Initialization
1. Start session with command: "Follow the protocol in your .windsurfrules"
2. System locates memory bank directory
3. Reads and validates core files
4. Builds relationship map
5. Processes all contents
6. Creates cross-references

### Update Strategy

#### Primary: Real-Time Updates
1. Monitor project-relevant events continuously
2. Filter based on relevance
3. Update appropriate files immediately
4. Maintain cross-references
5. Preserve chronological order

#### Backup: UMB Protocol
The "Update Memory Bank" (or "UMB") protocol is defined in `.windsurfrules` and can be triggered when needed:
- End of significant work sessions
- When explicitly requested
- For bulk updates
- As a verification step

UMB Protocol Actions:
1. Halts current task immediately
2. Reviews entire chat history
3. Updates all relevant memory-bank files
4. Cross-references all changes
5. Verifies update completeness

### Content Management
- Direct file updates for efficiency
- Structured section organization
- Automatic cross-referencing
- Timestamp-based tracking
